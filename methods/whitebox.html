            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <article>
                <p><b>White Box Testing</b> (also known as Clear Box Testing, Open Box Testing, Glass Box Testing, Transparent Box Testing, Code-Based Testing or Structural Testing) is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determines the appropriate outputs. Programming know-how and the implementation knowledge is essential. White box testing is testing beyond the user interface and into the nitty-gritty of a system.</p>
                <p>
                    This method is named so because the software program, in the eyes of the tester, is like a white/transparent box; inside which one clearly sees.

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <article>
                <p>
                    A tester, usually a developer as well, studies the implementation code of a certain field on a webpage, determines all legal (valid and invalid) AND illegal inputs and verifies the outputs against the expected outcomes, which is also determined by studying the implementation code.

            <h3>Levels Applicable To</h3>
            <article>
                <p>White Box Testing method is applicable to the following levels of software testing:</p>
                <ol>

                    <li>Unit Testing: For testing paths within a unit
                    <li>Integration Testing: For testing paths between units
                    <li>System Testing: For testing paths between subsystems

                </ol>
                <p>However, it is mainly applied to Unit Testing.</p>

            <h3>White Box Advantages</h3>
            <article>
                <ol>

                    <li>Testing can be commenced at an earlier stage. One need not wait for the GUI to be available.
                    <li>Testing is more thorough, with the possibility of covering most paths.

                </ol>

            <article>
                <ol>

                    <li>Since tests can be very complex, highly skilled resources are required, with thorough knowledge of programming and implementation.
                    <li>Test script maintenance can be a burden if the implementation changes too frequently.
                    <li>Since this method of testing it closely tied with the application being testing, tools to cater to every kind of implementation/platform may not be readily available.
                    <li>White Box Testing is like the work of a mechanic who examines the engine to see why the car is not moving.
