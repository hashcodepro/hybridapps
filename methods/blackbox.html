            <article>
                <p><b>Black Box Testing</b>, also known as Behavioral Testing, is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional.</p>

            <article>
                <p>This method is named so because the software program, in the eyes of the tester, is like a black box; inside which one cannot see.</p>
                <p>Black Box Testing is contrasted with White Box Testing. View Differences between Black Box Testing and White Box Testing.</p>
                <p>This method of attempts to find errors in the following categories:</p>
                <ol>

                    <li>Incorrect or missing functions
                    <li>Interface errors
                    <li>Errors in data structures or external database access
                    <li>Behavior or performance errors
                    <li>Initialization and termination errors

                </ol>
            </article>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <article>
                A tester, without knowledge of the internal structures of a website, tests the web pages by using a browser; providing inputs (clicks, keystrokes) and verifying the outputs against the expected outcome.

            <h3>Levels Applicable To</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Black Box Testing method is applicable to all levels of the software testing process:</p>
                <ol>

                    <li>Unit Testing
                    <li>Integration Testing
                    <li>System Testing
                    <li>Acceptance Testing

                </ol>
                <p>The higher the level, and hence the bigger and more complex the box, the more black box testing method comes into use.</p>

            <h3>Black Box Testing Techniques</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Following are some techniques that can be used for designing black box tests.</p>
                <h4>Equivalence Partitioning</h4>
                <p>
                    Equivalence Partitioning is a software test design technique that involves dividing input values into valid and invalid partitions and selecting representative values from each partition as test data.
                </p>

                <h4>Boundary Value Analysis</h4>
                <p>
                    Boundary Value Analysis is a software test design technique that involves determination of boundaries for input values and selecting values that are at the boundaries and just inside/outside of the boundaries as test data.
                </p>

                <h4>Cause Effect Graphing</h4>
                <p>
                    Cause Effect Graphing is a software test design technique that involves identifying the cases (input conditions) and effects (output conditions), producing a Cause-Effect Graph, and generating test cases accordingly.

            <h3>Black Box Testing Advantages</h3>
            <article>
                <ol>

                    <li>Tests are done from a userâ€™s point of view and will help in exposing discrepancies in the specifications
                    <li>Tester need not know programming languages or how the software has been implemented
                    <li>Tests can be conducted by a body independent from the developers, allowing for an objective perspective and the avoidance of developer-bias
                    <li>Test cases can be designed as soon as the specifications are complete

                </ol>
            </article>

            <h3>Black Box Testing Disadvantages</h3>
            <article>
                <ol>

                    <li>Without clear specifications, which is the situation in many projects, test cases will be difficult to design
                    <li>Tests can be redundant if the software designer/ developer has already run a test case.
                    <li>Ever wondered why a soothsayer closes the eyes when foretelling events? So is almost the case in Black Box Testing.
                </ol>
