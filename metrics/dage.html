                    Defect Age can be measured in terms of any of the following:
                </p>
                <ol>

                    <li>Time
                    <li>Phases

                </ol>
            </article>
            <h3>Defect Age (In Time)</h3>
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Defect Age (in Time) is the difference in time between the date a defect is detected and the current date (if the defect is still open) or the date the defect was fixed (if the defect is already fixed).
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Elaboration
                </h4>
                <ol>

                    <li>The ‘defects’ are confirmed and assigned (not just reported).
                    <li>Dropped defects are not counted.
                    <li>The difference in time can be calculated in hours or in days.
                    <li>‘fixed’ means that the defect is verified and closed; not just ‘completed’ by the developer.

                </ol>
                 <h4>Defect Age Formula</h4>
                <p><b>Defect Age in Time = Defect Fix Date (OR Current Date) – Defect Detection Date</b></p>

                <p>Normally, average age of all defects is calculated.</p>
                <h4>
                    Example
                </h4>
                <p>
                    If a defect was detected on 01/01/2009 10:00:00 AM and closed on 01/04/2009 12:00:00 PM, the Defect Age is 74 hours.
                </p>

                <h4>Uses</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For determining the responsiveness of the development/testing team. Lesser the age better the responsiveness.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </article>

            <h3>Defect Age (In Phases)</h3>
            <article>
                <h4>
                    Definition
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Defect Age (in Phases) is the difference in phases between the defect injection phase and the defect detection phase.
                </p>

                <h4>Elaboration</h4>
                <ol>

                    <li>‘defect injection phase’ is the phase in the software life cycle where the defect was introduced.
                    <li>‘defect detection phase’ is the phase in the software life cycle where the defect was identified.

                </ol>

                <h4>Defect Age Formula</h4>
                <p><b>Defect Age in Phase = Defect Detection Phase – Defect Injection Phase</b></p>

                <p>
                    Normally, average of all defects is calculated.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Example
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Let’s say the software life cycle has the following phases:
                </p>
                <ol style="list-style:decimal">

                    <li>Requirements Development
                    <li>High-Level Design
                    <li>Detail Design
                    <li>Coding
                    <li>Unit Testing
                    <li>Integration Testing
                    <li>System Testing
                    <li>Acceptance Testing

                </ol>
                <p>
                    If a defect is identified in System Testing and the defect was introduced in Requirements Development, the Defect Age is 6.
                </p>

                <h4>Uses</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For assessing the effectiveness of each phase and any review/testing activities. Lesser the age better the effectiveness.
                    </li>
                </ol>
