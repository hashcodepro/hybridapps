                    Cost of Quality (COQ) is a measure that quantifies the cost of control/conformance and the cost of failure of control/non-conformance. In other words, it sums up the costs related to prevention and detection of defects and the costs due to occurrences of defects.
                </p>
                <ol>

                    <li>Definition by ISTQB: cost of quality: The total costs incurred on quality activities and issues and often split into prevention costs, appraisal costs, internal failure costs and external failure costs.
                    <li>Definition by QAI: Money spent beyond expected production costs (labor, materials, equipment) to ensure that the product the customer receives is a quality (defect free) product. The Cost of Quality includes prevention, appraisal, and correction or repair costs.

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <article>
                <ol>
                <li>Cost of Control (Also known as Cost of Conformance)
                    <ol>
                        <li>Prevention Cost
                            <ol>

                                <li>The cost arises from efforts to prevent defects.
                                <li>Example: Quality Assurance costs

                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Appraisal Cost
                        <ol>

                            <li>The cost arises from efforts to detect defects.
                            <li>Example: Quality Control costs

                        </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Cost of Failure of Control (Also known as Cost of Non-Conformance)
                    <ol>
                        <li>Internal Failure Cost
                            <ol>

                                <li>The cost arises from defects identified internally and efforts to correct them.
                                <li>Example: Cost of Rework (Fixing of internal defects and re-testing)

                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>External Failure Cost
                            <ol>

                                <li>The cost arises from defects identified by the client or end-users and efforts to correct them.
                                <li>Example: Cost of Rework (Fixing of external defects and re-testing) and any other costs due to external defects (Product service/liability/recall, etc)

                            </ol>

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Formula / Calculation</h3>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Cost of Quality (COQ) = Cost of Control + Cost of Failure of Control
                </p>
                <p>
                    where
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cost of Control = Prevention Cost + Appraisal Cost
                </p>
                <p>
                    and
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cost of Failure of Control = Internal Failure Cost + External Failure Cost
                </p>

                    <li>In its simplest form, COQ can be calculated in terms of effort (hours/days).
                    <li>A better approach will be to calculate COQ in terms of money (converting the effort into money and adding any other tangible costs like test environment setup).
                    <li>The best approach will be to calculate COQ as a percentage of total cost. This allows for comparison of COQ across projects or companies.
                    <li>To ensure impartiality, it is advised that the Cost of Quality of a project/product be calculated and reported by a person external to the core project/product team (Say, someone from the Accounts Department).
                    <li>It is desirable to keep the Cost of Quality as low as possible. However, this requires a fine balancing of costs between Cost of Control and Cost of Failure of Control. In general, a higher Cost of Control results in a lower Cost of Failure of Control. But, the law of diminishing returns holds true here as well.
