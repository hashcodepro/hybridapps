            <article>
                <p>
                    Defect Detection Efficiency (DDE) is the number of defects detected during a phase/stage that are injected during that same phase divided by the total number of defects injected during that phase.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>defects:
                        <ol>

                            <li>Are confirmed and agreed upon (not just reported).
                            <li>Dropped defects are not counted.

                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>phase:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Can be any phase in the software development life cycle where defects can be injected AND detected. For example, Requirement, Design, and Coding.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>injected:
                        <ol>
                            <li>

                                The phase a defect is ‘injected’ in is identified by analyzing the defects [For instance, a defect can be detected in System Testing phase but the cause of the defect can be due to wrong design. Hence, the injected phase for that defect is Design phase.]

                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    
                </ol>

            <h3>Formula</h3>
            <article>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        DDE = (Number of Defects Injected AND Detected in a Phase / Total Number of Defects Injected in that Phase) x 100 %
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Target Value</h3>
            <article>
                <p>

                    The ultimate target value for Defect Detection Efficiency is 100% which means that all defects injected during a phase are detected during that same phase and none are transmitted to subsequent phases. [Note: the cost of fixing a defect at a later phase is higher.]

            <h3>Uses</h3>
            <article>
                <ol>

                    <li>For measuring the quality of the processes (process efficiency) within software development life cycle; by evaluating the degree to which defects introduced during that phase/stage are eliminated before they are transmitted into subsequent phases/stages.
                    <li>For identifying the phases in the software development life cycle that are the weakest in terms of quality control and for focusing on them.
