                Software Testing Myths and Facts
            </h3>
            <article>
                <p>Just as every field has its myths, so does the field of Software Testing. Software testing myths have arisen primarily due to the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lack of authoritative facts.
                    <li>Evolving nature of the industry.
                    <li>General flaws in human logic.
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Some of the myths are explained below, along with their related facts:
                </p>
                <ol>

                    <li><b>MYTH</b>: Quality Control = Testing. <br/>
                    <b>FACT</b>: Testing is just one component of software quality control. Quality Control includes other activities such as Reviews.
                    <li><b>MYTH</b>: The objective of Testing is to ensure a 100% defect- free product.<br/>
                    <b>FACT</b>: The objective of testing is to uncover as many defects as possible. Identifying all defects and getting rid of them is impossible.
                    <li><b>MYTH</b>: Testing is easy.<br/>
                    <b>FACT</b>: Testing can be difficult and challenging (sometimes, even more so than coding).
                    <li><b>MYTH</b>: Anyone can test.<br/>
                    <b>FACT</b>: Testing is a rigorous discipline and requires many kinds of skills.
                    <li><b>MYTH</b>: There is no creativity in testing.<br/>
                    <b>FACT</b>: Creativity can be applied when formulating test approaches, when designing tests, and even when executing tests.
                    <li><b>MYTH</b>: Automated testing eliminates the need for manual testing.<br/>
                    <b>FACT</b>: 100% test automation cannot be achieved. Manual Testing, to some level, is always necessary.
                    <li><b>MYTH</b>: When a defect slips, it is the fault of the Testers.<br/>
                    <b>FACT</b>: Quality is the responsibility of all members/stakeholders, including developers, of a project.
                    <li><b>MYTH</b>: Software Testing does not offer opportunities for career growth.<br/>
                    <b>FACT</b>: Gone are the days when users had to accept whatever product was dished to them; no matter what the quality. With the abundance of competing software and increasingly demanding users, the need for software testers to ensure high quality will continue to grow.

                </ol>
                <p>Management folk tend to have a special affinity for myths; so it will be your responsibility as a software tester to convince them that they are wrong. Tip: Put forward your arguments with relevant examples and numbers to validate your claims.</p>
