            Verification and Validation: Definition, Differences, Details:
            <article>
                <p>
                    The terms ‘Verification‘ and ‘Validation‘ are frequently used in the software testing world but the meaning of those terms are mostly vague and debatable. You will encounter (or have encountered) all kinds of usage and interpretations of those terms, and it is our humble attempt here to distinguish between them as clearly as possible.

                <p>It is entirely possible that a product passes when verified but fails when validated. This can happen when, say, a product is built as per the specifications but the specifications themselves fail to address the user’s needs.</p>
